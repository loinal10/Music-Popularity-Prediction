# Music-Popularity-Prediction
Music popularity prediction involves developing machine learning models to estimate the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features.
# Introduction
Predicting the popularity of music can help music streaming platforms understand user preferences, optimize playlists and enhance recommendation systems to improve user engagement and satisfaction. Music popularity prediction means using regression techniques to forecast the popularity of songs based on various music features and metadata. Expected results include accurate predictions of a songâ€™s future performance in terms of streams, downloads, and chart positions, which enable music producers, artists, and marketers to make informed decisions.
<br>
To get started with music popularity prediction, we need a dataset of various songs with their musical features and historical data on how much popularity the songs got. I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes 227 music tracks, each described by their music features along with additional metadata like track name, artists, album name, and release date.
# Features 
The given dataset contains various attributes related to individual music tracks. Key features include:
<br>
Energy: A measure of intensity and activity.
<br>
Valence: A measure of the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
<br>
Danceability: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing.
<br>
Loudness: Overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
<br>
Acousticness: Confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.
<br>
Tempo: The speed or pace of a given piece, measured in beats per minute (BPM).
<br>
Speechiness: Measures the presence of spoken words in a track.
<br>
Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
<br>
Popularity: The target variable indicating the popularity score of the track.
# Conclusion
So, this is how we can train a Machine Learning model for the task of Music popularity prediction with Python. Predicting the popularity of music can help music streaming platforms understand user preferences, optimize playlists and enhance recommendation systems to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
